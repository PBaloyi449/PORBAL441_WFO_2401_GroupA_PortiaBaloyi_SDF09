## Styling a footer

### Overview

In this project, I styled a footer so that it can be responsive to a desktop view, ipad view and an iphone view.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **Hover and Focus Effects**: I was able to apply the hover and focus effects on the button without any challenges.

#### Challenges Faced

-**CSS Frameworks**: I believe the only reason i faced challenges is because i skimmed through the notes due to a lack of time management. 
-**Adding social media icons**: I struggled to add social media icons on my footer, I also tried to ask chatGPT what I was doing wrong but got no help. I decided to leave them out.
- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: Adjusting the button to be the same size as the input field for smaller screens was challenging, but i managed to find a way to make it work.

#### Areas for Improvement

-**CSS Frameworks**: I have to go learn the notes I skimmed over.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was an invaluable hands-on experience in applying CSS Framework techniques. It helped solidify my understanding of CSS and its practical applications in web development. I look forward to building on these skills in future projects.
